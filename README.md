In the United States, lung cancer strikes 225,000 people every year, and accounts for $12 billion in health care costs. Early detection is critical to give patients the best chance at recovery and survival. One year ago, the office of the U.S. Vice President spearheaded a bold new initiative, the Cancer Moonshot, to make a decade's worth of progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in just 5 years. National Cancer Institute has provided high resolution lung scans of patients. The project aims to develop algorithm that will determine if the lesions in the lungs are cancerous. This will further help in early detection of cancer and will give more time to save patientâ€™s life.
